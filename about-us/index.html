                This website was created by 5 Stevens students studying project management. We identified a need for students to easily access extra learning materials relevant to their major. The purpose of this site is to connect Stevens students to relevant
                study and informational materials through a nicely organized page based on their major. Our group used AtlassianTrello to follow Agile project management with Scrum to track our progress on all the different portions of the website. This
                project was completed over the time period of one semester, while meeting several times a week to plan our sprints, reflect on our work, and follow the “daily standups” style for quick and efficient meetings.
